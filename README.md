  ## Description
  * This application was developed to allow for all our fellow DU Bootcamp classmates to stay in touch after class (think virtual yearbook). We wanted to create a space for classmates to continue connecting over code and learning from each other. As a user, I want to keep in touch with fellow classmates using a mobile-first social media style app.
